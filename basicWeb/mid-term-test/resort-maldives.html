      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        As soon as you arrive on a beach in the Maldives, you will be captivated <br>
        by the beautiful surroundings and magical colours of the ocean. It <br>
        creates a truly unreal impression â€“ a show that is sometimes difficult <br>
        to put into words. You will get a sense of space, of the ocean's <br>
        infinity beneath you and take in the hundreds of different shades of <br>
        blue as well as incomparable landscapes that you just won't see anywhere <br>
        else. You're bound to struggle for adjectives to describe this <br>
        archipelago, which will no doubt be one of the lasting impressions of <br>
        your holiday.
